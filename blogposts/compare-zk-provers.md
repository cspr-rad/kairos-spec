=== Comparison of ZK provers

Version 0.1 will be built using Risc0 as a ZK prover system, both for the individual ZKPs and for the rollup. The reason for this is a combination of Risc0's maturity in comparison to its competitors, and Risc0's clever combination of STARKs and SNARKs to quickly produce small proofs and verify them. In addition, Risc0 is one of few options which allow for GPU acceleration for the batch proof computation.
