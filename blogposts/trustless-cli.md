# The CLI's operating modes

The CLI should have two operating modes.
+ Trusting: the CLI should use the L2 server's endpoints to perform the
  interactions with the Validium.
+ Trustless: the CLI should perform all computations locally except for querying
  the data availability layer to obtain the Validium's state and submitting L2
  transactions to the L2 server.
